He has inculcated in me a strong love and passion for Debate through engaging and lively debating sessions back in primary school. Thank you Coach!\"\n\nRyan Chia\n\nDebater, Raffles Institution\n\nFormer Debater, Maha Bodhi School\n\n2 times Ranked Speaker\n\n3 times Best Speaker\n\n\"Throughout the  2 years of training, I learnt a lot about both debate itself  and\n\npublic speaking. Coach Firoze guided us not only in terms of how to analyse and write debate points, but gave feedback on how to improve our speaking style, taught us the\n\nimportance of teamwork, and how to work well with others. He constantly pushed us to stretch ourselves and engaged the class with team discussions and games. Coach\n\nFiroze encouraged us to think out of the box and share our ideas, always taking our points, however trivial, into deliberate consideration. I truly enjoyed the 2 years training under him.\"\n\nRachel Wong\n\nNUS High\n\nFormer Debater, Raffles Girls Pri Sch\n\nBest Debating School Div. l\n\n2 times Ranked Speaker\n\n4 times Best Speaker\n\n\"Coach Firoze takes pride in teaching his students. I had pleasure learning from him. He never hesitates to clear our doubts. The way he teaches not only helps us to improve our debating skills, it also gives a more clear understanding of the motion. Over the duration of 1 year that Coach Firoze has taught me, I have improved so much in public speaking and now I do not hesitate to pick up a mic and speak in front of a crowd. In the 1 year, I had improved from being a person who was scared to talk in front of a crowd or rebut against a point to becoming a confident speaker who got the Best Speaker under the guidance of Coach Firoze. \"\n\nC. Ashwinshiva\n\nVictoria School\n\nFormer Debater, Rivervale Pri Sch\n\nBest Speaker\n\n\"My experience under Coach Firoze had been nothing short of wonderful. Through his engaging methods and good-naturedness, Coach has successfully managed to kindle his pupil's interests in debate. All of his students are competent debaters and I can confidently say that anyone would be lucky to have him as his/her Coach.\"\n\nShwetha Murthy\n\nDebater, Raffles Girls School\n\nFormer Debater, Innova Pri Sch\n\n3 times Ranked Speaker\n\n4 times Best Speaker\n\n\"My experience working with Coach Firoze can only be described as fulfilling and enjoyable. He was ever so supportive, encouraging us and guiding us every step of the way. At first, with the change in coaches, we thought that it would be difficult to warm up to him. However, Coach Firoze was very friendly and warm, allowing us to adapt to his style and work with him\n\nvery well. Although we did make mistakes, Coach Firoze was very understanding and helped us overcome our problems. With his help, I felt that I had improved in my\n\ndebating skills. In the midst of all the hard work and practice, Coach Firoze still kept his sense of humour, making us laugh and making trainings fun. My last year in Debate was very enjoyable, thanks to Coach Firoze.\"\n\nCharlene Ong\n\nRaffles Girls School\n\nFormer Debater, Rivervale Pri Sch\n\n​\n\n\"Mr Tim has taught me a lot about theatre and how to better myself as an actress. The lessons and values I picked up from Mr Tim's class has stayed with me even long after I graduated from school. Mr Tim does not only care that I learn the foundation to drama but he cares for his students and their well-being. He makes sure that we feel safe and comfortable in a space to express how we feel and be accepted as people.\"\n\nJudith\n\nWest Spring Sec.\n\n​\n\n\"Mr Tim is a kind and helpful instructor who guides me to find my passion in theatre. I learnt from him to never give up my dreams and keep on going. His strongest aspect is his leadership skills in getting students to listen to him, resulting in cooperation from students.\"\n\nDominic\n\nSpringfield Sec.​\n\n\"Mr Tim has a great way of handling a class especially with me in the class. At first I thought that the programme would be boring but I became entertained when Mr Tim taught us as he knew how to make us laugh and learn at the same time. His teaching method is really impactful and great and I hope he can come back and teach us more again\"\n\nEthan\n\nWoodlands Ring Sec.\n\n​\n\n\"Firstly, I was much more engaged in debating through the many competitions that we were put through. The competitions were very important in helping to improve me as it allowed me to learn from other debaters and work together with my\n\nteammates. As for our debate trainings, the coaches  did great and managed to impart loads of knowledge and argumentative skills into us in a very short span of less than 2 years. I appreciate that the coaches were mostly punctual.\"\n\nChiang Yin Kit\n\nDebater, Hwa Chong Institution\n\nFormer Debater, Maha Bodhi School\n\nChampion, PSDO Div 1​\n\n​\n\n\"Regarding my primary school debate\n\nexperience, I was actually very unsure of whether to join, but I really do not regret my decision as I feel that it really gave me confidence in my speaking ability, as well as giving me a more informed understanding of world issues. I also felt that the coaches were very committed and that resulted in turning our team from average speakers to confident, award-winning ones.\"\n\nChia Kishen\n\nHwa Chong Institution\n\nFormer Debater, Maha Bodhi School\n\nChampion, PSDO Div 1​\n\n​\n\n\"I think that the debate training sessions were, on the most part, well planned and executed. When there were no competitions going on, I liked that we were still asked to engage in mock debates that were based on past year competition topics. This helped us to build upon skills that we would need later on in competitions and gave us practice in overcoming our nerves when speaking in front of an audience. Mr Anand would also frequently give us pointers on what could have been done better, which helped me better improve myself.\n\nBefore competitions, Mr Anand would discuss the motion with us when it was released. He would encourage us and help us brainstorm different points for both the proposition and opposition sides of the motion. Thanks to these discussions, I found it much easier to write my speeches and come up with unique points that could support our side.\"\n\nAda Sim\n\nRaffles Girls School\n\nFormer Debater, Maha Bodhi School\n\nChampion, PSDO Div 1​\n\n3 times Best Speaker\n\n​\n\n\"I largely enjoyed my time under Coach Firoze. He is a coach that is understanding and clear in his ways of teaching his pupils on how to write their debate speeches or how to debate. He can also spot potential in his students, as I somehow managed to get into the debate team despite not even completing a speech in the workshop... I'm grateful to him for his education that helped me hone my skills into a good debater (with 3 Best Speaker Awards may i add)\"\n\nDylan Pang\n\nHwa Chong Institution\n\nFormer Debater, St Joseph's Inst. Jnr\n\n3 times Best Speaker\n\n\"The experience was so enriching for me! Besides learning the skills for debating from Coach Firoze, I have also learnt from him how to be a good leader to others! Thanks to him, I am now a confident speaker and my self-confidence has been boosted since then!\"\n\nJeremy Tan\n\nDunman High\n\nFormer Debater, St Joseph's Inst. Jnr.\n\nRanked Speaker\n\n3 times Best Speaker\n\n\"Coach Firoze greatly helped me improve my debating skills through rigorous and well planned training sessions in which he provided high-quality written materials to expand my vocabulary and give me a better idea of what a proficient debate speech should sound like. I fondly remember him training us how to offer and receive POIs with confidence and flair, which has honed my public speaking skills and refined my ability to answer questions intellectually and swiftly. I will remember him as my very first debate coach, and the person who helped to set up a strong foundation for my future debating, not only in grasping the rudiments of debate, but how to speak with clarity and conviction.\"\n\nLara Tan\n\nDebater, Raffles Girls School\n\nFormer Debater, Raffles Girls Pri Sch\n\n2 times Best Speaker\n\n\"Coach  is a very capable and exceptional debate coach. Throughout the debate\n\nexperience with him, I was able to sharpen my argumentative skills, and learnt how to be persuasive when trying to push forth a point. Coach's guidance allowed us to hone our debating skills, and his constant motivation allowed us to succeed at debate.\"\n\nSanjaay Babu\n\nRaffles Institution\n\nFormer Debater, Rivervale Pri Sch\n\nBest Speaker\n\n\"Coach Firoze helped me and the rest of his students become better debaters. On top of imparting a useful set of skills and techniques to use on the floor to us, he has also been a kind and nurturing presence who genuinely cared about us. Under the guidance and tutelage of Coach, one is guaranteed to improve in terms of speaking, forming arguments and thinking on their feet.\"\n\nEmily Tan\n\nDebater, Raffles Girls School\n\nFormer Debater, Raffles Girls Pri Sch\n\nRanked Speaker\n\n​\n\n\"Coach Firoze was an invaluable source of advice, guidance and motivation. Throughout my debating journey in primary school, he never failed to offer critical and much-needed advice as my team and I prepared for various debating competitions. He gave constructive  criticism to help us improve, but never did he put us down. Coach Firoze was an inspiration to me as he provided insights on the motions given as well as world issues, guiding us to see the world with an open mind from different viewpoints. He always reminded us of the importance of viewing the debate from all angles.\n\nCoach Firoze is a very talented Debate Coach. He is also a passionate coach who helped his students to use words with conviction. I would strongly recommend Coach Firoze to all debate students as the wonderful experience you will gain is priceless.\"\n\nIman Nabilah Yasmeen bte Yunus\n\nRaffles Girls School\n\nFormer Debater, Raffles Girls Pri Sch\n\nBest Speaker\n\nBest Debating School, Div. l\n\n\"Mr Tim is a really insightful and disciplined teacher.Every activity he does has a meaning behind it which means any time with him is a productive learning experience.\"\n\nJonathan\n\nWest Spring Sec.\n\n​\n\n\"The training was good. The coaches (Mr Anand and Coach Firoze) were not too overbearing, but also made sure the team stayed in line while allowing us some space to be ourselves and have fun. The coaches prepped us well for our debates, including what to do and how to make full use of given time during an impromptu debate. They gave a much needed structure, along with their experience and debating tips and expertise to the team.\"\n\nEthan Fan\n\nFormer Debater, Maha Bodhi School\n\nChampion, PSDO Div 1​\n\nBest Speaker, PSDO Finals\n\n​\n\n\"Mr Anand's help in preparing us for our debates are much appreciated, especially since he spent much of his time outside of our training hours to help us make amendments to our speeches. Without him, we probably wouldn't be able to secure the First Runners Up title in PSDO.\n\nI felt that the training he gave us was really well-guided. It made us think and understand the topics better. The impromptu debates we had within our team was good training for us to keep us on our feet and think of points on the spot. Coach Firoze's and Mr Anand's feedback about how we spoke and wrote our speech have taught us a lot, and I can definitely say that I have improved a great deal ever since.\"\n\nNatasha Nadira Imran\n\nFormer Debater, Temasek Pri Sch\n\nFirst Runners Up, PSDO Div 1​\n\nBest Speaker\n\n\"Mr Anand's friendly and open-mindedness made it easy for him to interact with his debate students. Together with the hard of Mr Anand, we won all three of the Preliminary Rounds and emerged First Runners Up in the PSDO 2017.\n\nDebate skills were strengthened by the many interesting and lively Debate sessions Mr Anand held with the Debate Team. He is able to confidently deliver his message across while improvising on some of the ideas  by the Debate Team. Mr Anand is well liked by the Debate members, as he provides constructive feedback to consistently improve the team, and also cracks small jokes which lightens up the whole atmosphere, motivating us to never lose track of our plans and goals.\"\n\nShernice Ng\n\nFormer Debater, Temasek Pri Sch\n\nFirst Runners Up, PSDO Div 1​\n\n​\n\nTestimonials\n\n## GET IN\n\n## TOUCH\n\nMessage sent.
