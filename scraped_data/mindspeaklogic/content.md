## 10 Years of Shaping the Future of Communication

This year, MindSpeak Logic proudly celebrates 10 years of empowering students to think critically and speak persuasively.

Their 10th anniversary marks not just a milestone, but a renewed commitment to their partners; the parents, teachers, and schools who trust them.
